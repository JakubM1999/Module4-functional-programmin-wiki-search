<p>In this project I wanted to go a bit deeper to what react offers and how to use it so I got this Wikipedia API from Youtube video and used that to create this "wiki-search engine" and it came out pretty well. What you can do is that you can search for everthing that is on Wikipedia, You get search results below and if you click on read more it'll take you to the page that you searched for. I did a bit of styling and I like how this came out also.</p>

<p>I think that I learned a bit more about react and it's functions and I like it! I feel confident that I gaind the knowledge and skills that needed to be gained and I hope you like it. :)</p>
